title: "POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF \ NARRAGANSETT BOAT CLUB"
date: "Last revised February 13, 2018"
---

Introduction
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the Constitution has ably guided the Club through the years, is does not provide the detailed information needed to handle many situations that occur within the club and on the river. This manual has been written to help the officers and members of the club with these problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Policies and Procedures that follow strive to be consistent with the Constitution and subject to review by the Board of Governors and its committees. The Board of Governors reserves the right to modify this document at any time and newer policies may be established that have not been included in this document.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary means NBC communicates with membership is via The NBC Google Groups Page. Members are responsible for being familiar with club rules contained below and as updated/modified from time to time via Google Groups: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/narragansett-boat-club-membership



Use of Facilities
================================================================================

Decorum
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proper decorum by all members and visitors at Narragansett Boat Club is required at all times. A minimum of shirts, shorts and foot covering must be worn at all times while on the dock, in the building and on club property. As a member of the club with a long standing excellent reputation, it is also important to maintain proper decorum while traveling and racing as a representative of Narragansett Boat Club.

Opening the boathouse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The front door is the main entrance to the boathouse and should be used as our primary point of egress unless equipment is being brought into the boathouse. Your membership key can be used on all locks, padlocks and deadbolts throughout the building with the exception of the Director’s Office that is keyed differently. The garage bay door is operated simply by pushing the up or down button to the right of the door. The exterior key pad also operates the door. You need the code to operate the door from the outside. See the Captain for the code.

Closing the Boathouse
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check to see if other rowers are still out by clicking the “View Reports” then “Boats Out” buttons on the logbook computer screen to see what boats are still listed as out. The Logbook Computer is on the left side of the logbook table. Also check to see if any shells are missing from the racks. If anyone is still out, leave a pair of slings on the dock for them. Lock the boathouse by simply closing the overhead door with the switch to the right of the door. If you are the last person, check the doors and windows upstairs to see that they are shut and secure. Make sure that the showers and taps are completely turned off and turn off all lights. The boathouse doors are set to lock behind you but can be set in the open position with a hex key. This is often done during peak instruction hours so please be sure they are set to auto-lock before leaving the building. The boathouse is only open from the hours of 5:30am to 9:30pm.

Locker space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lockers are available on a first-come basis to all active members. When the number of members requesting lockers exceeds the number available, continued use of a locker will be guaranteed to those rowing more than 100 miles per year. Any member requesting a locker space shall see the Captain who will keep an accurate waiting list. Lockers must be completely emptied for the month of January every year for renovations. Any locks will be cut and the contents removed. There are also a number of day lockers in the men’s locker room for day use only, any contents left in a day locker overnight will be removed.

Private shell space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Grandfathered" racks have been made available to a limited number of NBC members in recognition of past service to the club. These spaces are not transferable and will continue to be available provided that each boat's mileage exceeds 500 miles per year and said boat owners remain NBC members in good standing without interruption. No further grandfathering will be allowed.

Private shell storage policy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the club goals related to racks, in priority order:

  - Meet demand for boats at times of highest demand (currently 5:45 am – 7 am weekdays and 6:30 – 8AM weekends plus certain high demand lesson and/or program periods, as identified by the Director of Rowing)
  - Increase club revenues to the extent practicable
  - Minimize normal wear and tear on club boats
  - Avoid having to remove private boats - for collegial reasons

  a. The Captain has full authority over all racks both inside and outside the boathouse
  b. The fee for a private boat rack for a shell shall be determined yearly by the BOG. Team and temporary boat storage may be available, please contact the Captain and/or the BOG for pricing and availability. Racks are not guaranteed from year-to-year and must be re-applied for annually.
  c. Club boats will always have priority of rack space over private boats.
  d. If there is insufficient available space to accommodate this request the applicant will be scored using the criteria below under Section 2.5 m and added to the queue for the following calendar year.
  e. If storage space is available, members may store a private boat at the Boat Club with the understanding that his/her boat will be removed from the club with a one-month notice at the discretion of the Captain or the Board of Governors. If a member is asked to remove his/her boat the collected rack fee will be refunded at a pro-rated basis from the first of the year.
  f. If a private shell owner allows Club members to use the boat without restrictions, the Captain may offer to waive the rack fee, cover the boat under the Club insurance policy, and help pay for repairs required from wear and tear and damage from use by the Club. Limited restrictions on the use may be requested by the Owner of the boat and may be accepted or rejected by the Captain.
  g. In the event that the Captain or the Board of Governors deems it necessary to ask a club member to remove his/her boat from the club, the boat with the least number of trips in the previous calendar year will be the first removed from the club followed by the boat with the next fewest trips. The process will be continued until all necessary rack space is made available to the Club. Trips are determined as the number of times a boat is rowed. Only one trip per day per person will be counted. Extra credit may be allowed for rush hour rowing (see goal 1 above) and physical size (very large or small rowers who don’t fit in most club boats) in tiebreaker situations only, at the discretion of the Captain.
  h. For ranking purposes in the allocation of Private racks at the NBC, “Trips” are defined as rows in the boat that is stored in the boathouse.
  i. If a private boat goes to a regatta, each day rowed counts as one “trip” per person who rowed regardless of how long the shell is away from the Club, how many races are held, or how many times the person practices at the event.
  j. If a private boat is broken and under repair for a limited period of time, (1 to 8 weeks), rows by that person in a like club boat are counted as “trips” on the broken private boat during that repair time. When a person requests a rack for the first time, only “trips” as defined here-in in the type of boat the person is requesting storage for, count in calculating the ranking of the person’s application.
  k. If a person shares a boat, all “trips” on the boat count in the ranking.
  l. If a rack is shared for multiple boats, trips on all boats (subject to the one trip per rower per day limit) accrue to maintaining that use of the rack.
  m. In the event demand for private rack space at NBC exceeds the number of racks designated for such use, the following protocol will be employed;
    1. Applicants for a private rack will be scored on three criteria; 1X miles/trips rowed in previous year, length of membership and service to club.
      a. Exceptions to Criteria;
        1. Grandfathered rack space – Members with grandfathered rack spaces who meet appropriate criteria will not be scored.
        2. Juniors - Juniors participating in the NBC junior racing program (referred to in other documents as the High-Performance Program or “HPP”) will have up to 4 designated 1X rack spaces located on the dock behind the Zephyr’s. The HPP coach has authority to assign those spaces to individual juniors who are NBC members in good standing and participants in the NBC HPP, however all other criteria including fees must be observed.
        3. Temporary/transient rack use – at the Captain’s discretion and dependent on availability.
    2. The criteria for indoor vs outdoor spaces will be the same. Assignments made at Captain’s discretion (i.e. boats with removable riggers that can be stored next to a similarly equipped boat may be given an outdoor rack regardless of score.)
    3. Rack holders will be re-scored on all three criteria annually as necessary and will retain their rack only if there are no higher scoring applicants. If there is not a shortage of private racks this scoring will not be necessary, and racks will be assigned at Captain’s discretion.
    4. Members who are over 65, have been NBC members for at least 20-years and maintained a rack for 10 of those years can continue to hold their rack so long as they row 250 miles per year.
    5. Unless you have a boat stored at NBC riggers may not be stored on site except by permission of the Captain.
    6. If demand for private racks does not exceed available rack supply, award of racks will be at the discretion of the Captain. Except as noted otherwise above rack space is not guaranteed for either current rack holders or new applicants.
  n. This policy supersedes all other by-laws or written advice with regard to boat storage policy.

Private oar storage policy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. All Club members are encouraged to use Club oars.
  b. The fee to store private oars in the boathouse shall be determined annually by the BOG.
  c. A club member may store no more than one set of oars at the boat club without permission from the Board of Governors or the Captain.
  d. Oars not used regularly (at least once a month) shall be removed from the boathouse or they will be assumed to be available for general use and moved to the other side of the boathouse.
  e. Oars shall be painted as follows: Stripe Color shall be navy blue. Background shall be Gloss white. Stripes shall be 1” wide. Space between stripes shall be 1”. Stripes shall start 1” in from upper outer tip of the oar and go inward (toward the boat) at a 30-degree angle.
  f. Members must use oars bearing Club Colors at all races where they are entered and racing as NBC.
  g. Oars must be identified with the owner’s name written on the sleeve of the oar in indelible magic marker or on tape around the shaft.

Boathouse rental
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Members, with the permission of the Board of Governors, may rent the boathouse for non-commercial purposes. The renter must sign a rental agreement detailing rules and regulations. Renters must be present while the club is rented, are responsible for the conduct of their guests, and must insure that the boathouse is left in good condition and properly secured upon leaving. A charge of $200 per day and a deposit of $200 are levied.

Pets are not allowed in the boathouse or on the dock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Smoking is not permitted in or on boat club property
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use of Equipment
================================================================================

Using club boats
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use only those shells you are certified to use by the Captain. Unless you are using your own private oars, use only Club oars, located on the river side of the boathouse. The club has many new Concept II hatchet oars that can be used with most shells. Use of club launches must be approved by the Captain or the Director of Rowing. Socks must be worn while rowing in club boats, without exception.

Taking out a shell
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Single shell usage is on a first come first serve basis. Conflicts should be resolved between conflicting parties, however if no satisfactory resolution is available parties should contact the Captain.
  b. Doubles and Quads have the highest demand and have an online signup sheet that can be accessed on the shared Google Doc called NBC Boat Signup Form. This form is also available on the website under Member Resources. If you have forgotten the password, please write webmaster@rownbc.org or the Captain.
  c. If needed, clean any dirt or grime from the oar sleeves Put your oars on the dock with blades facing up and, if they're not already there, bring down a pair of slings, a bucket and sponges.
  d. If you are unsure of yourself, arrange for help carrying your shell to the water. Make sure you have a clear pathway to the dock. Before taking your shell off the rack use a Styrofoam block to raise the shell on the rack above yours. Do not bump your oarlocks, riggers or hull into the other shells. As you walk your shell out of the house hold the boat securely and be wary of other shells and gusts of wind.
  e. Once your shell is on the water or in the slings, check it for damage and for tightness of oarlock, rigger and boot-stretcher hardware. Make sure your boat has a bow ball and functioning heel restraints. Be aware of motorboat traffic: if there are any wakes, hold your shell away from the dock. Put oars into the oarlocks, dockside first. The red tape on the oars is for the port side, green for starboard. Do not jam the shafts into the oarlocks. Make sure the oarlocks are closed before getting into the shell.
  f. Shut the overhead door by pushing the button to the right of the door.
  g. Upon returning to the dock, to open the door, punch the code into the gray box to the left side of the
  overhead door.

Getting into the boat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Sculling
    1. Make sure both sculls are flat and extended all the way through the oarlocks as far as the buttons will allow. Position the grips aft of the tracks over the boot stretchers, holding both grips with your riverside hand.
    2. Place your riverside foot on the footpad between the tracks at stern end. Hold the dockside rigger with your dockside hand. While holding both sculls with your riverside hand and the rigger with your dockside hand, stand in the shell and then gently lower yourself onto the seat. Place no weight on the splashboards.
  b. Sweeps
    1. Always wait for instructions from the Coxswain. Shells are always launched downstream. You will be guided to extend portside oars out before entering the boat.
    2. Place your riverside foot on the footpad between the tracks at stern end. Hold the dockside rigger with your dockside hand. While holding the oar handle with your riverside hand and the rigger with your dockside hand, stand in the shell and then gently lower yourself onto the seat. Place no weight on the gunnels.

Rowing on the river
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigation of Eights and Fours is done by a coxswain. It is important to pay attention to the Coxswains’ commands at all times. Be aware of everything around you at all times; don't assume anything; leave nothing to doubt. Do not try to row any harder than your ability to maintain safe control. It is more important to develop a smooth style than a strong but sloppy one. The Seekonk is a tidal river with strong currents and eddies, especially near its bridges. Be careful. The following rules are written for Scullers and Coxswains, however, it is important for all rowers to understand navigation of the Seekonk.
Follow these common-sense rules:

  a. When rowing up river, keep to the East Providence half of the channel or river. When going down river towards the bay, stay on the Providence side. All traffic should pass port to port.
  b. When rowing with other boats, always make steering allowances for your companions. Don't cut them off when you steer around buoys and give them plenty of room when you pass through bridges. If you're in a narrow spot with traffic coming against you, move to the starboard side in single file. If a faster boat is overtaking you, move to starboard.
  c. If faster boats are approaching, always move to the starboard side of the river to be overtaken.
  d. Always keep an eye out for buoys, floating debris and motorboats. At least every ten strokes look to see what's in front of you. If a large wake is approaching, turn your shell parallel to the wake and keep your oars flat on the water. Ride out the wake.
  e. If you hit something, hold onto your oars. If anything is broken, collect the pieces, if possible, to see if they can be salvaged.
  f. Beginners should not row beyond buoy #9 to the North and the railroad bridge to the South.
  g. The tide level determines when you have to row in the channel. The indicator line is the flat rocks north of the Boat Club. If the water level is below the lowest flat rocks, stay in the channel between the red buoys and green cans, except that you may cut buoy #6 when rowing northward in the channel. When the tide is high enough, you may row on the racecourse keeping to the starboard side of the river and being alert. Other boats may be practicing on the course. Never row on the East Providence side of the red buoys. When heading north past Buoy #17, always stay in the channel no matter what the tide level may be.
  h. Returning from Pawtucket, stay in the channel until you reach Buoy # 19.
  i. You may enter the racecourse, if the tide is high enough, or continue south in the channel
  j. During sprint racing season (spring/summer) the race course may be closed in the AM between 5:30-7 as boats are participating in training pieces. Members not participating must avoid this area during those times – notice will be provided electronically to membership via Google Groups announcing these restrictions.
  k. During Head racing season (autumn) the Head of the Seekonk (“HOTS”) course (see NBC website for course map) may be closed on Saturday mornings between 6:30-8AM as boats are participating in training pieces. Members not participating should avoid this section of the Seekonk during these times. Notice will be provided by Google groups and signage on dock. This practice event is open to all members.

### Basic Rowing Navigation Rules for the Seekonk ###

  1. All boats should pass port to port. Please move as far to starboard as possible to allow oncoming traffic adequate clearance. Keep to the right, stay out of the middle.
  2. Slower traffic must yield and move to starboard (right as you face bow) to allow faster traffic through.
  3. Shells turning around must check in all directions to be sure not to interfere with other boats traveling the river.
  4. Powerboats should control their wake around shells. It is best to approach relatively close to oncoming traffic, cut the throttle, eliminating your wake to let shells pass, and then increase throttle to a normal pace.
  5. If you see a shell approaching and the rower(s)/coxswain is not where he/she should be, let them know. Communicate.

#### Navigation Rules for the Seekonk Northbound Shells ####

  1. All shells must pass through the main arch of all bridges when rowing north. The only exception is for Brown University boats launching north from the Marston Boathouse.
  2. Brown University boats launching north from the “Marston Boathouse Arch” shall cross over into the channel soon after buoy #1 and assume normal navigation rules.
  3. After passing through the Railroad Bridge all shells should immediately turn to starboard and stay close to the East Providence shore thereby giving oncoming traffic plenty of clearance in this narrow part of the river. Coxswains aim for the blue building on the foundation of the old Red Bridge.
  4. Stay to the starboard side of the main arch of the Henderson Bridge (Red Bridge). This is especially important during the warmer months where powerboats will be passing through the main arch.
  5. Pass well to the starboard side of the river by the Narragansett Boat Club.
  6. It is acceptable to cut the red buoy #6 when proceeding up the channel or the race course. If you are going up the race course, please check for south bound channel traffic before cutting across the channel onto the race course.
  7. All northbound shells on the race course should row in the middle of the river. Coxswains aim for the Pawtucket radio tower. Scullers aim your stern on the left abutment of the main arch of the Henderson Bridge. Do not row north up the Providence shore under any circumstances.
  8. After passing the starting line and when passing buoy #17 shells should cut back into the channel and continue normal navigation rules to Pawtucket.

#### Navigation Rules for the Seekonk Southbound Shells ####

  1. Form Pawtucket stay to the starboard side of the channel. If you are going up the race course, cut to starboard (to the Providence shore) after buoy #19 heading for Swan Point. Watch for Brown University starting stakes in the river during the spring.
  2. After passing Swan Point aim for the Narragansett Boat Club. This will put you in lane 1.
  3. Stay 20 – 30 feet clear of the Narragansett Boat Club docks when passing. Bear in mind that there are often 5-10 boats launching or landing at the same time. During the summer months there are countless boats in front of the boathouse, many of the scullers are beginners who are instructed to stay close to the docks in a “holding pattern”. This means they will be rowing in an oval pattern from the docks to the finish line, cutting across the river and travelling north to the red buoy #6 then crossing back to complete the oval.
  4. Pass through the right arch of the Henderson Bridge and stay close to the Providence shore. Continue through the main arch of the Railroad Bridge and stay in the channel. Watch for Brown boats that may have launched from Marston Boathouse and may be crossing over the channel area between red buoy #2 and green buoy #1.
  5. All traffic approaching this crossover area that is not landing at the Marston Boathouse shall proceed with caution and pass close to green buoy #1 with a heading toward the right arch of the Washington Bridge giving launching boats from Brown plenty of clearance.
  6. Pass through the right arch of the Washington Bridge. All boats not landing at Brown stay clear of the Marston Boathouse arch.

When you capsize
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The heel restraints in your shell should allow you to release your feet. Your shoelaces or Velcro fastener should not be so tight that you cannot slip your feet out easily. If they don’t release, push on the backs of the shoes with your hands to free them. If you turn over near shore, move to shallow water and get back into your shell just as you would at the dock. NEVER LEAVE YOUR SHELL. Keep the shell away from rocks. IMPORTANT EXCEPTION If you capsize in the late fall or in the spring, get back into or onto your boat as soon as possible! Do not leave the boat to try to swim to shore—the cold water can kill you. If you flip over far from shore or in deep water, follow these not-so-simple steps:
  a. Get the boat upright and get control of your oars. Roll the seat to the bow end of the tracks.
  b. While holding the handles of both oars in your stern hand, with blades flat on the surface for stability, put your other hand between the tracks where you would normally step. Push up and onto the tracks where you would normally step and rotate your hips and sit on the shell, raise your handles to balance the boat and bring your feet into the boat
  c. Swing your feet into the cockpit then place your strongest foot between the tracks so that you can raise yourself enough to slide the seat back under you. This is not easy to do. It’s awkward, clumsy and can easily damage a racing shell so we don’t recommend it except in a real emergency or if you are using one of the training singles which are more ruggedly constructed.
  d. If your boat is unrowable (a broken rigger for example) and the water is cold, you can paddle the shell like a surfboard. As you swim or paddle against the current, keep the shell pointed slightly toward the near shore.
  e. Return to the boathouse immediately to get warm and dry.

Docking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Sculling Boats: Approach the dock from the north unless the tide and/or wind are very strong from the north. Take care not to hit the dock. Once you’ve landed, get out of the shell. Put your riverside foot on the footpad at the stern end of the tracks, hold both oars with your riverside hand, hold the dockside rigger with your other hand and pull up with your arms as you push with your riverside leg to stand in the shell. Do not put your feet onto any other part of the boat. Steady yourself by holding onto the rigger, not the washboards. Once you are up, you may safely step out with your dockside foot first. Do not step on the boot stretchers.
  b. Sweep Boats: Coxswains should always approach the dock facing down river. Approach the dock slowly and with only the oars overlapping the dock. Do not allow the rigger to overlap the dock. Wait for a coach or until someone on the dock can stop the boat and pull you close to the dock. Instruct all rowers to lean away from the dock.
  c. Persons standing on the dock who are catching sweeps boats should "catch" the first incoming oar, usually bow. Push against it to keep the bow from hitting the dock. Once the boat has slowed enough, tell stroke and six, if necessary, to back it so that the stern swings into place alongside the dock. Do not let go of the bow oar until the boat is completely parallel to the dock.

Putting your shell away
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Carefully remove the oars from your oarlocks, riverside oars first. Close the gates to your oarlocks. Pick up your shell and place it onto the slings. Take your time. If the shell is too heavy, or if it is windy, get help.
  b. Open drain plugs to release any water, which may have entered. Open the ventilation ports. Wash the hull; tracks and riggers with soapy water then rinse the hull, cockpit, decking and oars with fresh water. Pay special attention to rinsing metal parts (tracks, oarlocks, seat axles), which quickly deteriorate if any salt-water remains on them. As often as possible but no less than once a week, clean your shell with a sponge and soapy water. Do not use cleaners that contain any abrasives that will harm the hull. Dish soap or similar liquid soap will remove grease, tar, or oil. Check the shell for damage or equipment problems. Please try to avoid wetting shoes in any boat.
  c. Before putting your shell away, make sure you have a clear pathway into the boathouse, to the rack, and that a Styrofoam block is propping up the shell above the rack intended for your boat.
  d. Do not leave your shell unattended at the dock or in the slings. Use care in placing your shell onto its rack so as not to hit anything or scratch the hull. Oars should be returned to their designated spot.

Damage to Equipment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. The person(s) rowing when the damage occurs must take full responsibility for the repair, regardless of the cause of the accident. The rower(s) may not row until the repair and transportation is arranged and the captain or lieutenant confirms this is so in writing. The rower(s) must pay the deductible and the transportation costs. Deductibles (the cost paid by the rower(s)) is/are as follows: Single Double Four or quad Eight $250.00 $350.00 $500.00 $1000.00
  b. Boats should be returned from repairs as quickly as possible. Waiting for the repair shop to drive this way with their trailer is not acceptable. If it costs something to arrange for a pick up or return, the cost is born 100% by the crew.
  c. The rower(s) is/are responsible for a boat once the rower(s) or the rower’s agent removes it from the rack. That includes all on water and off water incidents regardless of the circumstances, the only exception being a volunteer transporting a boat for the benefit of the club. A rower or group of rowers who choose to put a boat on a trailer for transportation to a regatta is responsible as described above for any damage to the boat that occurs during transportation.
  d. Repeat offenders are subject to demotion at the discretion of the Captain.
  e. Damage must be reported before leaving the boathouse by writing a brief description on the whiteboard behind the computer desk. Also, an e-mail should be sent at the earliest opportunity to the Fleet Manager giving additional detail as necessary, and identifying the parties rowing the boat when the damage occurred. If the damage is such that further rowing is not possible until repaired, put a “Do Not Row” tag on one of the riggers.

Signing out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After putting away your shell and oars, sign out in the logbook by recording your trip mileage. There's a mileage chart by the door leaving the boat bay. If you have any accidents, incidents or general observations, record them in the log as well. All accidents must also be reported to the Captain by phone or in writing.

General Safety Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone rowing must be a capable swimmer. Before ever getting into a shell on the water, a rower must understand the following terminology: bow, stern, port, starboard, weigh enough, ready to row, back, tie-in, untie, stop, the stroke, bow person, seat numbers in between and what number/seat s/he is that day. The term “stop” should be used only when talking to a specific crew in a race. When a coxswain or coach wants a crew to stop immediately, the proper term is “Weigh enough! Hold water!” Shells without bow balls and functioning heel restraints may not be used. Coaches of junior groups must carry a cell phone in the launch. Launch drivers and barge coaches must wear a PFD or a flotation suit. In accordance with state law, children under 13 years of age must wear a U.S. Coast Guard–approved PFD.

Safety Guidelines for Rowing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rowers must, at all times, be prepared to find themselves out of their boat and in the water. This can happen gradually, as a boat sinks due to a slow leak, quickly, if the boat is in a collision which results in severe damage to the equipment, or even before you realize it if you catch a particularly nasty crab and get tossed from the boat. However it happens, finding yourself in the water can be a scary, startling and, potentially, dangerous event. In order to minimize risk to yourself and others on or in the water with you, you must follow the following rules.

GENERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR ROWERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. The very first, and most important, rule is to keep calm. No matter how you ended up in the water, no matter how cold or rough the conditions, panicking will only make it worse. You must think and be aware of others in the water – someone may be injured and need help. The cox should take charge if the coach is not nearby. Count down from bow to ascertain whether everyone is present.
  b. Your oars and your boat, even if capsized or in pieces, float. Stay with your boat. Know that your shell has been designed for flotation. Your boat is not a Personal Flotation Device (PFD); it is an emergency flotation device and your oars are neither, a personal or emergency flotation device. The club recommends that all unaccompanied boats carry Coast Guard approved PFDs. A copy of the Coast Guard Regulations concerning PFDs is available upon request from USRowing. If necessary, swim with your boat or oar to shore – NEVER attempt to swim on your own. Almost every rowing fatality that has occurred was the result of someone trying to swim to shore. You are safest with your equipment. You may have been hurt when you entered the water; you may not realize the strength of the tide or current; or you may not realize the effect the water temperature may have on your strength.
  c. If possible, call for help. Wave your arms. Yell. Swing a piece of clothing over your head.
  d. Your coach will be in a launch and should approach you as quickly as possible. You should be aware, however, that the launch cannot come to you too fast – the motor must be shut down on approach to a rower or rowers in the water, and the coach must paddle in the last few yards. This is for your safety. The Seekonk water is dark, and we cannot risk hitting anyone with an active motor or boat.
  e. Once your coach approaches, he or she will have to make some important decisions quickly. If you are hurt, or if you know someone else in the water is hurt, tell the coach as calmly and quickly as possible. The coach will then assess the situation and instruct you on what to do. This may entail assisting the injured rower into the launch, staying with the injured person until more help arrives, etc.
  f. If no one is injured, the coach may get you and any others in the water into the launch. This is a difficult procedure. The sides of the launch are high, and the launch can be capsized if weight is not properly distributed. The coach may have to stay on the far side of the launch as you attempt to get in. If you do get in, sit on the bottom of the launch, not the seats, and help the coach balance the launch – the launch will be more stable that way. Each launch is equipped with a stirrup to assist you in getting in.
  g. Each launch has a weight limit. If the limit is exceeded, the launch gets less stable, may sit too low in the water or may even capsize. Therefore, it may take more than one trip of the launch to shore. The coach will provide a life jacket for you. If the water is cold, you must try to keep your head and chest as far out of the water as possible by climbing onto the shell. Even at its widest point, the Seekonk is not wide, so the trip will be short.
  h. As with the rowers in the water, you must not panic! While your adrenaline will flow, and your nerves may become frayed, you must maintain control. Your actions and decisions may save a life.
  i. Count the rowers and coxswain so that you know where everyone is.
  j. You must get to the rower(s) in the water as quickly as possible, but with safety as your top concern. If the water is choppy, the tide is moving quickly, or the wind is blowing, proceed with extra caution. Approach the shell from downwind. You must shut down the motor a few feet away from the rowers even in calm conditions. Your final approach must be made with a paddle. If the conditions are rough, you may have to circle around the rowers to find the easiest and safest way in.
  k. As you approach the rowers, distribute life jackets and find out if anyone is injured. If anyone is, they must be your top priority. You should not, however, get out of the launch. Once you leave the launch, it may drift away or be too difficult to get back in. Getting in the water yourself only adds another at-risk person.
  l. If possible, let the rowers climb into the launch. Carefully attempt to pull them in. Use the stirrup that is tied to the middle seat of each motorboat. Hold the stirrup out so that the person in the water can place his/her strongest leg into the stirrup. Then, before he/she tries to stand up, you may need to move to the opposite side of the motorboat to counterbalance the incoming weight. You may have to remain on the far side of the launch to keep it from tipping. When the rowers do get in, have them sit on the bottom, not the seats. The launch will be more stable that way. Proceed to the closest shore. Warn rowers of stepping lightly on the bottom to avoid stepping on sharp objects. Keep the lower unit of the motor clear of the mud and rocks. If you cannot take all of the rowers in the water in one trip, leave those most comfortable with the shell, and pick them up on a second trip. Throw out lifejackets and have the rowers put them on. Your most important job is to keep the launch upright and functioning. Taking too many rowers at once may result in the launch capsizing, turning a bad situation into a potential crisis.
  m. Only when all rowers are safely ashore should you worry about the equipment. 3.12 Seasonal and weather restrictions
    a. From December 22nd to February 28, rowing is allowed only under the following conditions:
      1. Rowers must be certified "A" level by the Captain or Lieutenant unless rowing as a part of an NBC affiliated program.
      2. Rowing is allowed in Eights, Quads, Fours (with coxswain) and Doubles only.
      3. Rowers must be accompanied by one or more launches
      4. Rowers must be at least 18 years old
      5. Rowers must pay a monthly motorboat use fee, regardless of number of trips during the month. (For purposes of this section an NBC Affiliated Program includes lessons, classes, programs, etc. run out of NBC as a part of its Rowing Programs.)
  b. In March only rowers rated A or B are allowed to row as well as any rower participating in an NBC affiliated program. A motorboat, for safety, must accompany all rowers without exception, that includes all sweep boats.
  c. During the months of April, November 1st through December 21st rowers must use the “Four oars on the water” system. That means rowers must be accompanied by at least one other boat and must stay within 250M of each other. The club recommends rowing team boats as often as possible during this period unless you can get back in a boat quickly and efficiently in the event of an emergency. Rowers of any other classification other than “A” or “B” may only row in classes under the direct supervision of a coach during this period.
  d. Any launch driver must be capable of running the launch and of assisting a sculler into the launch should the rower be unable to get back into their shell after flipping.
  e. FOG: Rowers may not row in fog unless the Henderson Bridge is visible from the garage door of the boathouse. If fog sets in while you are on the water, move slowly, and be prepared to stop quickly. Use a sound making device (cox box, horn, or whistle) to advise other boats of your location as you take your boat to shore, following the shore back to the boathouse. If the Henderson Bridge is not visible from the dock, rowing is not permitted. If the Henderson Bridge is visible but the red buoy #6 north of the boathouse is not visible boats may proceed to the South only and may not row beyond Marston Boathouse.
  f. ICE: Rowing is not permitted when there is ice on the river.
  g. LIGHTNING: Do not row in an electrical storm. If the storm is upon you, take your boat ashore and wait for the storm to pass. It is recommended to wait 30 min after the last sign of lightning before going back out on the water.
  h. WAVES: Waves are generated by winds, tides, currents, or wakes from passing boats. Because shells are vulnerable to high waves, specific care is needed with approaching wakes. If approaching wake is higher than the gunwale, the shell should be turned parallel to the wake to avoid having part of the shell unsupported by the water. It is possible to split a shell under these conditions. Rowers should stop rowing and lean away from the approaching wake, with oars on the wake side lifted slightly. If the wakes are lower than the gunwale and widely spaced, continue to row without a course adjustment. Deep and closely spaced wakes that are lower than the gunwale may be taken at a 90 degree angle with the bow directly toward them.

Light conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited light condition is defined as any time between sunset and sunrise. Great care should be taken when rowing in darkness or near-darkness. Take extra care to look and listen. Minimize conversation. Be careful not to get too close to shore or known hazards. Limit your rowing to familiar waters while rowing at dusk, dawn, or in the dark rules for rowing in the dark:
  a. Sculling boats:
    1. Only “A” rowers may row a single or bow a team boat during limited light conditions
    2. Rowers of “B” qualification and lower may row in team bows in any seat but bow
    3. Groups of 3 to 4 boats are strongly recommended
    4. Boats must have at least one very bright white light on the bow and at least one stern facing light
    5. Light colored or high visibility clothing is strongly recommended.
  b. Sweep boats:
    1. Four+ must be coxed by at least a “B” rated coxswain or be accompanied by a coach’s launch.
    2. Eight+ must be coxed by an “A” rated adult coxswain or accompanied by a launch.
    3. Four- must be steered by a 4- rated bow seat.
    4. Must use at least one very bright white light on the bow and at least one on the stern. It should be visible enough to warn approaching vessels.
    5. Light colored or high visibility clothing is strongly recommended. Legal lights for motorized vessels are red/green bow lights and a white stern light with an all-around white steaming light above the level of the colored lights.

Hyperthermia and Hypothermia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hyperthermia occurs when there is an increase in body temperature, usually when the air temperature is above 76 degrees, and the victim is exposed to sun and heat in combination with a decrease in fluids. It may occur when a) sweat cannot easily evaporate; b) the body is being heated by the environment; c) water loss from sweat and respiration is not replaced, and dehydration occurs. Two serious conditions may result:

Heat exhaustion - signs are throbbing headache, nausea, cool skin, chills, sweaty, and pale pulse. Action - drink water, shade from sun, and treat for shock.

Heat Stroke is life threatening - signs are behavior changes, unconsciousness, hot but not sweaty, flushed warm skin and rapid pulse. Action- douse with cool water, shade from sun, fan, ensure the airway is open, always get medical assistance as soon as possible.

To avoid these problems in hot and humid weather:
  a. Maintain a high fluid level. Drink water before leaving the dock and frequently while on the water.
  b. Avoid sunburn by using sunscreen.
  c. Wear light clothing.
  d. Remain in the shade when off the water.
  e. Plan activity level consistent with the degree of heat and humidity.

Hypothermia occurs when a victim is subject to cold temperatures, cold water, ice or snow. There is potential danger for hypothermia when the water temperature is below 80 degrees and very dangerous when the water temperature is below 50 degrees. Symptoms include feeling cold, turn bluish and shivering, and followed by numbness, apathy, lethargy, disorientation and loss of mental capacity.

Action if cold and shivering:
  a. Get out of the water quickly, even on top of the capsized boat. Heat loss is 25 times great when in the water.
  b. Huddle with others.
  c. Move to shelter quickly, remove wet clothing and rewarm body. In mild hypothermia conditions, rewarm in a shower, tub, or with warm blankets.
  d. Do not give any liquids to drink, treat for shock.
  e. Continue to rewarm and always obtain medical assistance as soon as possible.

Action if cold and shivering had stopped:
  a. Treat as above but DO NOT RE-WARM EXTREMITIES! If victim is no longer shivering, the torso must be re-warmed to avoid circulation of cold blood to the heart. This can kill. Wrap the victim in a warm blanket and apply heat to under arms and groin area; wrap again in a separate blanket. Wrap each arm and leg separately to prevent rapid re-circulation of blood to the heart. Hot packs should not be placed directly on the victim; a thin layer should be used to protect the victim from burning. If possible place the victim in a sleeping bag with a warm person.
  b. Administer artificial respiration and CPR if necessary. Always obtain medical assistance as soon as possible.

Cold water immersion - Be aware that in very cold water people have survived as long as one hour underwater. Recover a victim immediately and even though there may be no sign of life, administer CPR efforts until medical assistance is obtained.

An AED is located downstairs by the front entrance of the boathouse.

Guests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regular members may have up to 6 guest visits that can be used during each calendar year and an individual guest rower may only row up to 6 times (total) at no charge. Members are expected to use discretion in choosing equipment for their guests and are liable for any damages caused by their guests. Guests must be 18 years or older. Those below the age of 18 may only row with written parental permission and the Captain’s approval. Other visiting rowers may be granted permission to use Club craft at the Captain's discretion. All Guests must adhere to the Club’s Policies and Procedures.

Use of Doubles, Pairs, Quads, Fours, Eights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Team boats (doubles, quads, fours and eights) are very popular and very expensive assets for the club. There have been numerous instances of problems with the team boats related to poor handling, poor cleaning and lack of reporting and follow up on damage. Volunteers are assigned, one for each of the fourteen team boats, to be boat monitors. The boat monitors will NOT be responsible for fixing the boats themselves. The boat monitor will monitor the condition of one assigned boat and note any repairs needed, problems identified and state of cleanliness. Upon being notified or discovering ANY unsatisfactory condition, the monitor will in turn notify the Captain in writing or by email. The Captain will then arrange to have the appropriate members fix the problem.
All rowers must clean the shell tracks after rowing!

Club Boat Use Requirements;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. “A” Doubles: The Bow sculler must have “A” level sculling certification. If you are unsure of your certification level, please contact the Captain. Van Dusens may be rowed with pair riggers if each partner is an experienced sweeps rower.
  b. “B” Doubles: The Bow sculler must have “B” level sculling certification. The stroke seat sculler must be training single certified.
  c. “C” Doubles: The Bow sculler must have “C” level sculling certification.
  d. Coxed Fours+: All rowers must be Sweep rowing certified or have permission of the Captain. If the crew or coxswain is at least “B” rated then a launch is not required. Novice and/or Junior crews must be accompanied by a launch.
  e. Coxless (Straight) Four- The bow must be “A” rated and have Straight Four Bow Certification. Being bow rated for a quad does not automatically provide bow rating for a straight four, this certification is obtained from the Captain or his/her designated agent.
  f. Quads: If the boat is rowed with a coach directly overseeing the session, there are no sculling rating requirements. If the boat is rowed without a supervising coach, The Bow sculler must have “A” level sculling certification and Bow Seat Approval from the Captain. The most experienced rower with the best vision should row in bow seat. The other three rowers do not have to be racing single certified but should have some sculling experience. NOTE: One rower in the quad must obtain adequate instruction from the Captain or Lieutenant to use the hoist. Failure to obtain adequate instruction can lead to personal injury and/or severe damage to the boat. Please use extreme caution.
  g. Eights: All rowers in Eights must be Sweep rowing certified or have permission from the Captain. If the coxswain is an “A” rated coxswain then a launch is not required. A crew rowing without a launch must use an eight with FISA floatation certification, currently the Chason and the McCauley. Eights rowing without a launch should stay north of the Route 195 bridge. A novice crew must be accompanied by a coach in a launch. The coach will usually determine which boat a rower will be authorized to row. The coach accompanying the eight should use a 14’ safety launch complete with safety box and 10 life jackets. If 4 or more of the rowers in an 8 are juniors then a launch is required regardless of coxswain rating. It is strongly recommended that the coxswain get the attention of someone on the dock to spot the eight when landing.

Junior Rowing Policy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. A Junior Rower is defined as any rower under 18 years of age. All individuals must become full regular members on January 1st following their 18th birthday.
  b. Junior rowers must conform to all rules applying to regular members.
  c. Junior rowers may scull only under the supervision of a certified NBC Coach in the NBC Program or under the following conditions:
    a. With an adult member who is at least 21 years old and is on the water with the junior rowers.
      i. If the adult member is rowing, he/she may supervise up to 4 junior rowers
      ii. If the adult member is in a launch, he/she may supervise up to 6 junior rowers
      iii. If the adult member is in a launch, he/she must be qualified per the Policies and Procedures manual to operate a launch, have the approval of the Captain and be certified by the Director of rowing.
    b. The adult member must be a designee of the junior rower’s parent or guardian.
    c. When cold weather rules are in effect, the adult member must be “A” rated.
    d. Parents are responsible for communication with the adult that the junior proposes to row with and will personally inform the adult that they have given their permission to the Junior to row with that adult.
  d. Junior scullers are not permitted to row singles in March outside of a NBC Rowing Program.
  e. Junior Sweep rowers must always be accompanied by a Coach’s launch At all times.
  f. Parents and Juniors must read and understand rowing rules for juniors. The parent is responsible for approving the junior’s adult on-water supervisor. Parents understand and acknowledge the risks of rowing, including cold water, hypothermia, collisions, wind, waves, and tides.

Scheduling for Boat Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. The computer on the log book stand is used to reserve team boats and can be accessed anywhere at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak36QSGs4a5wdDgyQXlsUEhSN0JfQnNuakVhY0hwZXc&hl=en_US#gid=89
  b. If there is significant demand, singles will also be added to the sign out sheet in the future. Currently, we rely on the excellent negotiating skills of our membership to work out any potential boat conflicts.
  c. A sculling boat may be reserved for a maximum time of 90 minutes per day. The individual who reserved the boat must be present at the start of the reserved time or he/she will lose priority for that particular day. Those who repeatedly fail to appear will lose their reserved time slot. Persons rowing five or six days per week will have priority over those rowing less often. Generally, faster rowers will have priority. “Faster” can be defined as the most competitive in his/her class.
  d. Sweep boats will have the following priority:
    1. Competitive Member boats in Advanced Program
    2. Non-competitive Member boats in Advanced Program
    3. Member boats in Development Program
    4. Member boats formed outside Rowing Program
    5. Non-Member boats in Development Program
  e. Regatta entries: Entry forms are submitted to the Captain for approval. Equipment Request should be entered on this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1- S147w1vjlA4hJ1GGdRbsij66FAEvcUxiIpgG19eh8Y/edit#gid=391293829 Members who sign the sheet will have priority over those who don't. If you do not see a request sheet for a particular regatta, please send a note to the Captain. Class members may sign up for boat use during home regattas under the supervision of the coach. With permission of the Captain, class participants (who are not members) may sign up for boat use at off site regattas.
    1. The non-member had to currently be in a program class.
    2. Permission to use a boat at an off-site regatta must be given by the Captain.
    3. The non-member’s coach must be present at the regatta and agree to assist the rower.
    4. Members will have priority over non-members for regatta boat use.
  f. Conflict resolution and exceptions: Members should try to resolve scheduling conflicts on their own. If it is not successful, they should approach the Captain for a solution.
  g. Individuals who leave the city for no more than two weeks may retain their training slot provided written notice is given on the schedule board. Those who vanish for a week or more without leaving word may lose priority.
  h. Selected crews and limited entries: The Captain shall sign entry forms for events with limited entries or other restrictions. The Captain who will then determine the priority of representing crews will hold entry forms and fees for these regattas until ten days before the due date.

Equipment Transport
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. No club equipment shall leave the boathouse without the Captain's permission. Shells shall be taken for regattas only as long as they are required for competition, travel and preparation. They must be safely returned to the boathouse as soon as possible.
  b. There is a $25/day/person fee. The fee shall cover up to 2 consecutive days of rowing NBC boats off- site. The amount does not increase with multiple races/boats over that 2-day period. After 2 days the boat is away from NBC the fee increases an additional $25/day/person. There is no impact on the fee whether the boat is trailered or car topped. Private boats on club trailer pay a flat fee of $25 regardless of the length of travel. Fees are due prior to removal of boat from boathouse.
  c. A shell may not be taken from the club for "recreational" purposes without the approval of the Captain.
  d. All members who take shells on trips must be adequately trained in loading/ securing, driving, and storing/protection of the equipment. Car racks that are used for carrying shells must be clamped or mechanically attached to the car's roof. Suction cups are not adequate. A safety line must be used to attach the front end of all car-topped shells to the vehicle in addition to those means normally used to fasten the boats to the boat rack. An aft line to the vehicle is not a bad idea either, as it will greatly reduce any leverage created by the shell on its rack and the car top. A red flag must be attached to the rearmost part of overhanging shells.
  e. If the trailer is used the driver must be certified by the Captain or the BOG before transport.

Rigging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rigging of all club boats is determined by the Captain, no changes are permissible without consulting the Captain or the Fleet Manager. This also covers club oars. Rowers requiring a slightly lower rig should use pads to raise their bodies.

Maintenance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals are responsible for overseeing their boat's welfare. By using a boat regularly, you are assuming responsibility for the routine maintenance of the boat. Report special needs of particular boats to the Captain.

Club oars
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Club oars shall be adjusted to the same dimensions for consistency. No club member may adjust club oars without express permission of the captain or lieutenant.

Certification
================================================================================

Use certification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  a. Upon request, the Captain will arrange on the water testing for members wishing to move into the training or racing shells. These shall include demonstration of fundamental skills of Sweeps or Sculling or both as well as working knowledge of navigation rules on the Seekonk. Members seeking racing shell certification must be familiar with navigation rules and precautions for the harbor area and Providence River as well. The Captain will post a list of each member’s certification three times during the rowing season. The Captain may add restrictions to any rower, as specific safety concerns require.
  b. The following is the rowing progression system in sculling boats
    1. To advance from a “D” Single (Zephyr) to a “C” Single (Dolphins and Peinerts marked “C”) a rower must scull a minimum of 50 miles in a Zephyr (or a sculling class) and pass an evaluation by the Captain or Lieutenant.
    2. To advance from a “C” Single to a “B” Single a rower must scull a minimum of 200 miles in a “C” Single and pass a rowing test administered by the Captain or Lieutenant. The following must be successfully completed:
      a. Display good “rowing form”
      b. Row with no feather without tipping or stopping for 30 strokes
      c. Do 360 degree river turns in both directions
      d. Emergency stop from at least 20 SPM at full pressure without flipping
      e. Row, steer, and navigate continuously without stopping to look frequently
      f. Land against and with the current
      g. Land rowing in and backing in
      h. Launch from mid-dock without assistance
      i. Demonstrate how to take out a boat and return a boat to its rack in the boathouse
      j. Take and pass an ad hoc oral navigation quiz
      k. Explain “low tide” rowing rules
      l. Explain procedures for reporting and taking responsibility for equipment breakage
      m. Explain pre-launch activities (weather check, sign out, lock doors)
      n. Explain cold weather and darkness rowing restrictions
      o. Demonstrate the proper way of adjusting foot stretchers and oar lock heights
    3. To advance from a “B” to an “A” Single a rower must scull a minimum of 1000 total single sculling miles (including from the Zephyr onward) while maintaining a record of responsible navigation and compliance with the safety rules, have a record of compliance with the policies and procedures, and have demonstrated taking responsibility for equipment used. Final determination of rating is at the discretion of the Captain or the Lieutenant.
  c. The following is the rowing progression system in Sweep boats
    1. A sweep rower must complete a minimum of two barge classes in order to row any sweep boat.
    2. The Captain or Lieutenant will administer a competency test to determine if the rower is qualified to move on to sweep boats.
    3. In order to row any sculling boats a sweep rower must complete the same sculling progression as mentioned above. Being an “A” level Sweep rower does not automatically qualify an individual at any level of sculling.
  d. Coxswains: Coxswain certification will be administered by the Captain or Lieutenant and will be rated “B” and “A” based on experience and knowledge and understanding of the river. A beginner coxswain has no rating and must always be accompanied by a launch. A coxswain must cox at least 50 trips on the Seekonk River to be “B” rated and 100 trips and be at least 18 years old to be “A” rated. Only “A” rated coxswains are allowed to steer NBC Eights without launch accompaniment.
  e. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any advancement may be made at the discretion of the Captain or Lieutenant.

New Members
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Captain will assess and certify the rowing ability of each new member. New members without adequate rowing skills will complete the first available rowing classes. If no classes are available, initial instruction will be arranged through the Captain.

Private Coaching Policy
================================================================================

  a. Private on water coaching is available for club members only and can be arranged through the Director of Rowing.
  b. All coaching for junior rowers must be arranged and run through the rowing program under the supervision of the Director of Rowing.
  c. Private on water Coaching in not available to non-members

Gifts and Gratuities
================================================================================

  a. The following guidelines apply to all Members of the Board of Governors, Employees, and Volunteers of NBC: With the understanding that small gifts are a customary expression of gratitude and kindness, it is expected that gift recipients, in connection with their position at NBC, use good judgement in determining the appropriateness of each gift received. Gifts exceeding $100 in value are to be reported to the Board of Governors and recipients are encouraged to redirect offers of gifts of this value and greater, to the NBC annual fund. Any gifts of cash or of direct monetary value are prohibited.
